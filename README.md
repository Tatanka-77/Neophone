# Building the app

If you have Android Studio, simply open the project, wait for the gradle synchronization and then build/install the app.  
It will download the linphone library from our Maven repository as an AAR file so you don't have to build anything yourself.

If you don't have Android Studio, you can build and install the app using gradle:
```
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
will compile the APK file (assembleRelease to instead if you want to build a release package), and then
```
./gradlew installDebug
```
to install the generated APK in the previous step (use installRelease instead if you built a release package).

APK files are stored within ```./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/``` and ```./app/build/outputs/apk/release/``` directories.

When building a release AppBundle, use releaseAppBundle target instead of release.   
Also make sure you have a NDK installed and that you have an environment variable named ```ANDROID_NDK_HOME``` that contains the path to the NDK.  
This is to be able to include native libraries symbols into app bundle for the Play Store.

## Building a local SDK

1. Clone the linphone-sdk repository from out gitlab:
```
git clone https://gitlab.linphone.org/BC/public/linphone-sdk.git --recursive
```

2. Follow the instructions in the linphone-sdk/README file to build the SDK.

3. Create or edit the gradle.properties file in $GRADLE_USER_HOME (usually ~/.gradle/) and add the absolute path to your linphone-sdk build directory, for example:
```
LinphoneSdkBuildDir=/home/<username>/linphone-sdk/build/
```

4. Rebuild the app in Android Studio.

## Native debugging

1. Install LLDB from SDK Tools in Android-studio.

2. In Android-studio go to Run->Edit Configurations->Debugger.

3. Select 'Dual' or 'Native' and add the path to linphone-sdk debug libraries (build/libs-debug/ for example).

4. Open native file and put your breakpoint on it.

5. Make sure you are using the debug AAR in the app/build.gradle script and not the release one (to have faster builds by default the release AAR is used even for debug APK flavor).

6. Debug app.

## Known issues

- If you encounter the `couldn't find "libc++_shared.so"` crash when the app starts, simply clean the project in Android Studio (under Build menu) and build again.
Also check you have built the SDK for the right CPU architecture using the `-DLINPHONESDK_ANDROID_ARCHS=armv7,arm64,x86,x86_64` cmake parameter.
